                    <p>
                    He was about six months old, and the ‘nicest’ puppy you could ever get your hands on. He wasn’t a tubby, rolly-polly
                    playful bugger, as puppies usually are. He was sweet, quiet, cuddly, and pulled on your heart strings in ways you never
                    thought imaginable. I think that’s what dogs do, really.<br>
                    It’s been almost six years now and he’s been my constant sidekick, my muse, the love of my life, my boy.
                   
                    I like to say that he got petted into his heavy coat (haha). He also had the cutest floppy ears that took two years to
                    erect into his pointy fox-like ones that he has now. They erected one at a time.
                    Oh, I didn’t even mention how he was when I got him!<br>
                    
                    Once REDBEARD was roaming an area where my friend worked and that area had an old pack of dogs. Packs usually don’t like stray
                    dogs, especially males, into their territory for obvious reasons. So my friend picked him up and got him to me. He was
                    oh-so-thin and frail. And in a few days, he was in the hospital because he was undernourished and had eaten wood amongst
                    other junk. It was the first time in my life I had ever cried in public. He was so tiny and helpless and perfect.
                    Anyway, in a few days, he was back to being him and though he’s got way more health problems than most Indies (Indies
                    are known to be hardy and strong), I always say that he probably does because he knows he gets more love and cookies
                    that way. Sly little bugger.<br>
                    
                    That’s about it really.<h1>I know I can go on about him forever but I guess that’s what happens when you’re in love huh!:-)</h1>
